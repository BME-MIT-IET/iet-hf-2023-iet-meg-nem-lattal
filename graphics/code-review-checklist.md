[ OK ] Does this code change accomplish what it is supposed to do?

[ OK ] Can this solution be simplified?

[ OK ] Does this change add unwanted compile-time or run-time dependencies?

[ OK ] Is a framework, API, library, or service used that should not be used?

[ ? ] Could an additional framework, API, library, or service improve the solution?
  - Better GUI
 
[ OK ] Is the code at the right abstraction level?

[ OK ] Is the code modular enough?

[ OK ] Can a better solution be found in terms of maintainability, readability, performance, or security?

[ ? ] Does similar functionality already exist in the codebase? If yes, why isnâ€™t it reused?
      - similar functionality, only differences is object type (same parent)

[ ? ] Are there any best practices, design patterns or language-specific patterns that could substantially improve this code? 
      - DRY: 
          - Cape, Bag, Axe, Gloves: simmilar code
          - Aminoacid, Nucleotide: simmilar code

[ OK ] Does this code adhere to Object-Oriented Analysis and Design Principles, like the Single Responsibility Principle, Open-Close Principle, Liskov Substitution Principle, Interface Segregation, or Dependency Injection?


## Logic Errors and Bugs

[ OK ] Can you think of any use case in which the
code does not behave as intended?

[ OK ] Can you think of any inputs or external events
that could break the code?

## Error Handling and Logging

[ OK ] Is error handling done the correct way?

[ OK ] Should any logging or debugging information
be added or removed?

[ - ] Are error messages user-friendly?
      - Error message appears only in console

[ ? ] Are there enough log events and are they
written in a way that allows for easy
debugging?
        - No logging event, but not needed

## Dependencies
[ OK ] Were updates to documentation, configuration, or readme files made as required by this change?

[ OK ] Are there any potential impacts on other parts of the system or backward compatibility?

## Security and Data Privacy
[ OK ] Does the code introduce any security vulnerabilities? No.

[ OK ] Are authorization and authentication handled correctly? Not needed.

[ OK ] Is (user) input validated, sanitized, and escaped 
to prevent security attacks such as cross-site 
scripting or SQL injection? Not needed.

[ OK ] Is sensitive data like user data or credit card
information securely handled and stored? Not needed.

[ OK ] Is the right encryption used? Not needed.

[ OK ] Does this code change reveal any secret
information like keys, passwords, or usernames? No.

[ OK ] Is data retrieved from external APIs or libraries
checked for security issues? Not needed.

## Performance
[ OK ] Do you think this code change decreases
system performance? Yes.

[ OK ] Do you see any potential to improve the
performance of the code significantly? Yes.


## Usability and Accessibility
[ OK ] Is the proposed solution well-designed from a
usability perspective? Yes.

[ OK ] Is the API well documented? Yes.

[ OK ] Is the proposed solution (UI) accessible? Yes.

[ OK ] Is the API/UI intuitive to use? Yes.

## Ethics and Morality
[ OK ] Does this change make use of user data in a way that 
might raise privacy concerns? No.

[ OK ] Does the change exploit behavioral patterns or human
weaknesses? No.

[ OK ] Might the code, or what it enables, lead to mental 
and physical harm for (some) users? No.


## Testing and Testability
[ OK ] Is the code testable? Yes.

[ OK ] Has the code change? No.

[ ? ] Have automated tests been added, or have related ones been updated to cover the change? No.

[ OK ] Do the existing tests reasonably cover the code change (unit/integration/system tests)? Yes.

[ OK ] Are there some test cases, input or edge cases
that should be tested in addition? No.

## Readability
[ OK ] Is the code easy to understand? Yes.

[ OK ] Which parts were confusing to you and why? Too many classes.

[ OK ] Can the readability of the code be improved by
smaller methods? Yes.

[ OK ] Can the readability of the code be improved by
different function, method or variable names? Yes.

[ OK ] Is the code located in the right
file/folder/package? Yes.

[ OK ] Do you think certain methods should be
restructured to have a more intuitive control
flow? No.

[ OK ] Is the data flow understandable? Yes.

[ OK ] Are there redundant or outdated comments? No.

[ OK ] Could some comments convey the message
better? Yes.

[ OK ] Would more comments make the code more

understandable? No.

[ OK ] Could some comments be removed by making the code itself more readable? Yes.
